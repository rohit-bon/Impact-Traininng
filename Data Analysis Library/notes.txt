Data Analytics Libraries:
    These libraries are use for performing manipulation on data 
    The various data analysis libraries are numpy, pandas, matplot, seaborn, scikit
    numpy stands for numerical python 
        numpy library used to solve complex mathematical problems
        using numpy library we can represent our data in matrix form
        numpy library is used to perform statistical operations suchb as mean, mean square value, standard deviation and variants etc.
    pandas
        pandas is also one of the library in python which is used to perform data analysis and manipulation
        data analysis operations such as cleaning, processing, modeling, and inspecting the data
        data manipulation operations such as adding the data, deleting the data, and applying modifications on the data
        pandas libraries are used to reduce the complexity and make our work easier
    matplot 
        these libraries are used to represent our data in graphical form 
        the graphical or pictorial representation will helpful to understand the application

    LOC and ILOC (Location and Index based Location)
        ILOC is purely based on index position i.e. we have to mention both row and column information index only
        In LOC we can access the data using the name field or column field
