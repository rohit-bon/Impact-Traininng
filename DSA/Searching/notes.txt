Searching Techniques in python:
    python supports 2 types of searching Techniques:
        1. Linear Search 
        2. Binary Search 
    Linear Search
        In the linear search we are going to compare key element with the each and every element present in the list 
        If the element found then it will return the index position of the corresponding element
        If the element is not available then it will return -1 i.e. -1 is indicated as element not found
        In the linear search we are going to compare each and every element with the key so  this algorithm will take more timme and time complexity is also more
    Binary Search
        In the  Binary search first 
            step1: we have to sort the element 
            step2: calculate low and high value i.e. low=0 and high=len -1
            step3: calculate the mid index position i.e. low+high/2
            step4: based on the mid position find out middle value in the list then compare midlle value with the key value if middle value is less than key value then increment the low, if middle value is greater than the key value then decrement the high with 1, if two conditions are not satisfied that will be indicated as middle value and key value both are equal, then return the index position.
            step5: if the element is not available then this algorithm will return -1 
        



Linear Search:

def linear_search(my_list,key):
    for i in range (len(my_list)):
        if my_list[i] == key:
            return i
    return -1
        
my_list = list(map(int, input().split()))
key = int(input())
found = linear_search(my_list, key)
if found == -1:
    print("Element not found.")
else:
    print("Element",key,"fount at",found+1,"Position and Index is",found)


Binary Search:

def binary_search(my_list, key):
    my_list.sort()
    low = 0
    high = len(my_list) - 1
    while low<=high:
        mid = (low+high)//2
        if my_list[mid] == key:
            return True
        else:
            if key > my_list[mid]:
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid - 1
    return False
            
my_list = list(map(int, input().split()))
key = int(input())
found = binary_search(my_list, key)
if found:
    print("Element",key,"is found in list.")
else:
    print("Element not found.")
