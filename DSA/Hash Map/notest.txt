Hash Set:
    Hash set is a collection of object 
    In hash table the data must stored in the form of key and value pair 
    Hash set internally uses the hash table  data structure to store the data items 
    Just like a set Hash set also does not allow storage of duplicate elements

Hash map and hash Table:
    Hash map and hash table both are same i.e. the way of storing and organising information
    Hash function will establish the relation between keys and values
    hash function is a function that accepts a string and returns a number 
    Hashing is a technique it is used in computer sciencce to effienctly store and retrive a data 
    It involves converting data into fixed set values called hash codes 
    This hash codes are used as indexes to store the data in data structures like  hash maps, hash tables and hash sets

Implementation of Hash Set in python.

hash_set = set()
print(type(hash_set))
hash_set.add(10)
hash_set.add(20)
hash_set.add(30)
hash_set.add(40)
print(hash_set)
hash_set.add(10)
print(hash_set)
search_element = 7
if search_element in hash_set:
    print("Element found:")
else:
    print("Not found:")


Implementation of hash map.
