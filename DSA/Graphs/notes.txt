Graph:
    Graph is a collection of vertices and edges
    Vertices will be represented by Circles or Nodes or Hole
    Edges will represent the lines 
    Edges will connects the Nodes 

Degree of a Node:
    The number of edges connected to each node is known as degree of that node

Size of a Graph:
    Size of a graph will represent the total numberr of edges in a graph 

Different types of graphs
    1. Directed and Undirected Graph
        Directed Graph 
            if the direction is indicated between the edges then it will be called as directed graph
        Undirected Graph
            If no direction is indicated between the edges is called as Undirected Graph 

    2. Weighted and Unweighted Graph 
        Weighted Graph 
            if the weight is specified between the edges then it is called as Weighted Graph
        Unweighted Graph
            if the weight is not specified between the edges then it is called as Unweighted Graph
    
    3. Cyclic and Uncyclic Graph 
        Cyclic Graph
            if the graph is forming a circle then it  is called as Cyclic Graph 
        Uncyclic Graph
            if the graph is not forming a circle then it is called as Uncyclic Graph
    
Representation of Graph
    Graps will be represented in 2 ways
        1. Using Multi Dimensional Array
        2. Using a list
    
    Using Multi Dimensional Array
            A B C D

        A   0 1 0 1
        B   1 0 1 0
        C   0 1 0 1
        D   1 0 1 0
    
Graph Supports 2 Traversal Technique
    1. BFS (Breadth Search First)
        BFS is similar to implementation of Queue
    2. DFS (Depth First Search)
        DFS is similar to implementation of Stack
    
    Queue works on the principle of First In First Out
    Stack works on the principle of Last In First Out
