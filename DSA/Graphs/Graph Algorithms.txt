Graph Algorithm:
    Discuss the Algorithm:
    1.  This Algorithm is used to find the shortest path between source and destination or we can find the shortest distance between source and destination.
    2.  In this Algorithm we will take two list, first list will represent the visited nodes and second list will represent the  distances.
    3.  If the node is not visited we have to consider like false, if the node is visited it will becomes true.
    4.  For every node we have to find Adjacent nodes.
    5.  Initally all the distances will be taken as infinity.
    6.  Once, After calculating the distances this corresponding list will be updated.
