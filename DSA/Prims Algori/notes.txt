Prim's Algorithm:
    Graph should be weighted, completed and undirected
    Step1:  Consider any Vertices
    Step2:  Find all adjacent selected vertices to all new vertices, select least weighted edge and include it in a tree, if least weighted edge form a circle then discqard it and consider next least weighted edge and include it in a min spanning tree
    Step3:   Perform Step2 until all vertices are included in a tree

    This algo is also used to find the shortest path
