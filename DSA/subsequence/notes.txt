longest increasing subsequence:
    Given an aaray of size n, the task is to find the lenght of longest increasing subsequence i.e. the longest possible subsequence in which the elements of subsequence are sorted in ascending order

    Implementation of longest increasing subsequence in recursive approach



max = 1
10 22 9 33 21 50 41 60
n = 8
maxEnd = 1

for begins 
1-8
1:
res = lis(arr, 1)
res = 1
if 10<60 and 2>1
maxEnd = 2

2:
res = lis(arr,2)
    maxEnd = 1
	for 1-2
	1
	res = 1
	if 10<22 and 2 > 1
	maxEnd = 2
	max = 2
res = 2
if 22<60 and 3>2
maxEnd = 3

3:
res = lis(arr, 3)
    maxEnd = 1
    for 1-3
    1:
    res = 1
    if 10<9 false
    2:
    res lis(arr, 2)
    res = 2
    if 22<9 false 
    max = 2
res = 1
